# Deal Desk Phase 9 — Release & Post-launch Iteration

Objective: execute the production rollout of Deal Desk & Commissions, monitor adoption, and plan the first post-launch iteration based on feedback and telemetry.

---

## 1. Release Execution

1. **Staging Verification**  
   - Ensure latest code deployed with feature flag enabled for staging tenant.  
   - Run smoke suite (Cypress) and key manual workflows.  
   - Verify reporting dashboards match seeded expectations.

2. **Production Rollout Plan**  
   - Enable feature flag for pilot tenants only.  
   - Monitor logs/metrics for 48 hours.  
   - Gather feedback from pilot brokers before wider rollout.  
   - Gradually expand flag to all tenants.

3. **Communication**  
   - Send release email/announcement to brokers highlighting new workflow & benefits.  
   - Publish support article and embed in app (e.g., feature spotlight card).  
   - Provide migration guide for existing deals (manual forecast entry until actual close).

4. **Support Readiness**  
   - On-call rotation aware of potential issues (calculation mismatches, CDA PDF problems).  
   - Track support tickets tagged `deal-desk` for trends.

## 2. Post-launch Monitoring

Metrics to track weekly:

| Metric | Target | Action Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forecast accuracy | ≥80% deals within ±10% | Investigate plan configs causing variance. |
| CDA approval time | Median < 1 day | Improve CDA workflow or notifications. |
| Payout approval latency | < 3 days | Follow up with accounting/brokers. |
| Agents nearing cap | Proactively notify at 80% cap. |
| Crash rate / errors | 0 critical | Immediate bugfix. |
| Feature adoption | % deals processed via Deal Desk | Identify training gaps if low. |

Use dashboards from Phase 6 + additional charts (flag adoption).

## 3. Feedback Loop

- Schedule weekly check-ins with pilot brokers during first month.  
- Create feedback form embedded in Deal Desk UI (“Report calculation issue”).  
- Log enhancement requests in backlog (e.g., multi-entity support, ACH integration).  
- Prioritize quick wins for post-launch iteration (Phase 9.1).

## 4. Post-launch Iteration Ideas

1. **Dual Agency Enhancements** — full support for listing + buying side simultaneously.  
2. **ACH/Wire Tracking** — integrate with payment providers or allow file uploads.  
3. **Advanced Reports** — multi-currency, team channel ROI.  
4. **Automation Hooks** — trigger tasks when deal hits milestones (e.g., notify accounting when payout approved).  
5. **Cap Notifications** — automated emails/SMS when agents hit thresholds.

Collect data before committing to roadmap.

## 5. Retrospective & Documentation Refresh

- Hold retro with dev/QA/product/support after 2–3 weeks; record lessons learned.  
- Update docs based on real-world edge cases encountered.  
- Archive feature flag plan once fully rolled out.

---

## 6. Success Criteria (Go/No-go)

- ✅ Pilot tenants complete full forecast → CDA → reconciliation cycle without major issues.  
- ✅ Support volume manageable (no P0 incidents).  
- ✅ Reporting accuracy validated against manual spreadsheets.  
- ✅ Leadership sign-off that KPIs measurable and meeting initial targets.

If criteria met, proceed to full tenant rollout and transition feature to general availability.
